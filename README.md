# Multilingual Image–Text Retrieval Demo

## Project title and purpose
This demo shows a minimal setup for retrieving images by text queries across languages. It illustrates how multilingual encoders can match user descriptions with a small set of captions.

## Description of features
* Sample captions in Yoruba and Mandarin
* Text query box powered by Streamlit
* Cosine similarity search with the LaBSE model
* Placeholder display for the best matched image and caption

## What’s implemented
* Loading of two example captions
* Embedding generation using sentence-transformers
* Simple Streamlit interface for querying
* Returns the most similar caption with its image name

## What’s next
Future improvements include adding real images, expanding the dataset, and providing more advanced search options.

## Why it matters
Multilingual image–text retrieval enables inclusive search experiences for speakers of different languages and showcases the potential of cross-lingual representation learning.

# Parts of this prototype were assisted using GitHub Codex under my direction.
